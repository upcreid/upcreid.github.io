I've quit Paris recently, to a more little City.

<!-- more -->

Because of the Covid stuff, but mainly to be closer to the nature.

It was in my mind since a long time, and the actual crisis, and my work, give me the opportunity to move away.

Remote Work is kind of OK.

I'm missing the office, and mainly the people, but since i'm not alone at home, it's easier to handle.

I was kind of afraid at the beginning, but i think i found my rhythm.

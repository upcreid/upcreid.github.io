**Class:** Mercenary  
**Ascendancy:** Tactician  
**League:** 0.3 League Starter to End Game  
**Author:** [Lazy Exile](https://www.youtube.com/@LazyExile)  
**Updated:** September 30, 2025

## Overview

A totem-based build revolving around **Ballista Totem (Mortar Cannon)** and **Banners** (War Banner, Defiance Banner) with a dual curse setup (Elemental Weakness, Temporal Chains). This is a comfortable totem playstyle where you drop totems and let them do the work while you focus on positioning and survival.

## Build Summary

### Defensive Features
- **Pinning mechanics** provide excellent crowd control on Tactician
- **Armour and Evasion** hybrid setup for decent tankiness  
- **Drop and run** playstyle - place totems and dodge while they fight
- Enemies are often killed before they can retaliate

### Offensive Features
- **Mortar Cannon** with 100% uptime through pinning mechanics
- **Dual Curse** setup (Elemental Weakness + Frost Bomb) is stronger than traditional crossbow builds due to Sceptre usage
- **Critical strike** scaling in endgame provides sufficient damage for pinnacle bossing
- Totems rarely die when positioned correctly

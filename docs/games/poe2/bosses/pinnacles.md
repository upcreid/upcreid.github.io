� **Notes:**
- Atlas Invitations (“Echoes of the Deep”, “Storm’s Summit”, etc.) drop from endgame content or are crafted from Crisis Fragments.  
- Some Pinnacle Bosses have *Uber* versions with new patterns and faster attack sequences (e.g. The Arbiter of Ash – Uber version).  
- All Pinnacle encounters are endgame-tier (area level 83+), requiring a fully developed build.
